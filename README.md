#Cited by

I was inspired by Lior Pachter's blog post ["A citation is not a citation is not a citation"](https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2017/01/18/a-citation-is-not-a-citation-is-not-a-citation/) to create this simple web page. I use the Pubmed API to view and classify the papers citing a given reference.
